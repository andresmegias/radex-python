# RADEX Python Interface

Python interface for using the software RADEX. It consists of two Python 3 scripts: `radex.py`, which is used with RADEX locally; and `radexonline.py`, which uses the online version of RADEX.

Each of the two scripts has its own user guide that you can read to learn how to use them.
