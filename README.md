# RADEX Python Interface

Python interface for using the software RADEX. It consists of a Python 3 script, `radex.py`, which is used with RADEX locally.

You can check the user guide ([`radex-userguide.pdf`](https://github.com/andresmegias/radex-python/blob/main/radexonline-userguide.pdf)) and the example files (inside the `examples` folder) to learn how to use it.
